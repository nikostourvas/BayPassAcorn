Removing output files of failed job run_baypass since they might be corrupted:
results/ACORN_VCF_Qrobur_minCov20IndelFilteredSNPs_Biallelic_miss0.1_ADP104_Subsampled_0.01_baypassSplitOut/chunk_14
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
